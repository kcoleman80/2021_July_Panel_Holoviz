Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text.

Compared to other approaches, Panel is novel in that it supports nearly all plotting libraries, works just as well in a Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, uses the same code for both those cases, supports both Python-backed and static HTML/JavaScript exported applications, and can be used to develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code to any particular GUI or web tools.

Panel makes it simple to make:

Plots with user-defined controls

Property sheets for editing parameters of objects in a workflow

Control panels for simulations or experiments

Custom data-exploration tools

Dashboards reporting key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends

Data-rich Python-backed web servers

and anything in between

Panel objects are reactive, immediately updating to reflect changes to their state, which makes it simple to compose viewable objects and link them into simple, one-off apps to do a specific exploratory task. The same objects can then be reused in more complex combinations to build more ambitious apps, while always sharing the same code that works well on its own.

Panel lets you move the same code freely between an interactive Jupyter Notebook prompt and a fully deployable standalone server. That way you can easily switch between exploring your data, building visualizations, adding custom interactivity, sharing with non-technical users, and back again at any point, using the same tools and the same code throughout. Panel thus helps support your entire workflow, so that you never have to commit to only one way of using your data and your analyses, and donâ€™t have to rewrite your code just to make it usable in a different way. In many cases, using Panel can turn projects that used to take weeks or months into something you finish on the same day you started, creating a full Python-backed deployed web service for your visualized data in minutes or hours without having to run a software development project or hand your work over to another team.
